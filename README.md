# Gesture-Based-Music-Control

Developed a real-time hand-tracking application using MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and track index finger and thumb positions from a webcam feed.
Designed a UI overlay to display live, hand-specific distance measurements between fingertips, enabling gesture-based input.
Integrated python-vlc to play audio files with programmatic control over volume and playback speed.
Implemented inter-process communication where the camera script  triggers the audio script.
Enhanced user experience with keyboard interrupt support (q key) to stop music playback cleanly during runtime.
Structured the application using modular Python scripts, with clear separation between vision input and audio output logic.
